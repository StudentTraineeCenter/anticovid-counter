# anticovid-counter

We are creating an IoT projects that takes advantage of IoT arduino platform in combination with Azure Cloud Services. Our pipeline consists of taking pictures of room by camera built into arduino board and sending them to the cloud where we utilize machine learning to count the number people in the frame. Owner can monitor the number of humans in a room and if it exceeds certain treshold given by the current covid-19 laws the owner can see it and act accordingly.
